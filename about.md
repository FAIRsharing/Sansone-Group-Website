# The Boss

I am an Associate Director, and Principal Investigator at the Oxford e-Research Centre, and a faculty member of the
Department of Engineering Science of the University of Oxford. I am also one of the founding members of the Digital
Research Cluster at Wolfson College, Oxford, and a Consultant for Springer Nature, and Founding Honorary Academic
Editor of the Scientific Data journal.

I hold a PhD in Molecular Biology from Imperial College of Science, Technology and Medicine, London, UK; after few
years working on vaccine genetics in an Imperial's spinnoff (now known as Emergent BioSolutions, Inc.) I moved to the
European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI, Cambridge) where I worked for nine years as a Project and Team Coordinator
and Principal Investigator, before moving to the Oxford e-Research Centre in 2010.
