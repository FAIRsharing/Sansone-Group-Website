            2024-2027:  <b>EU Horizon Europe “<a href="https://cordis.europa.eu/programme/id/HORIZON_HORIZON-INFRA-2023-EOSC-01-03/en">OSTrails: Planning, tracking, and assessing scientific knowledge production</a>"</b> - Lead PI: Natalia Manola, OpenAIRE; University of Oxford PI: Sansone SA. Lead contributors: Lister A., Thurston M. <i> An interdisciplinary project, involving 38 partners (including funders and research organizations, as well as EOSC Science Clusters) set to deliver methodologies, services, tools and guidance needed to plan research activity, track its impact and contribution, and assess its compliance with the FAIR principles. Specifically, for each stage, OSTrails aims to: PLAN by increasing the efficacy of Data Management Plans (DMPs), towards more researcher-centric and educative “machine actionable” DMPs (maDMPs). TRACK: by establishing an open, interoperable and high quality ecosystem of Scientific Knowledge Graphs (SKGs) supporting different types of research products, their relationships and metrics used to evaluate them. ASSESS: by delivering modular and extendable FAIR tests, which makes the metrics “machine actionable” (maFAIRTest), complemented by user guidance, and that can be implemented in tools assisting any stage of the research life cycle. Our Data Readiness Group contributes to the OSTrials' three stages via the use and enhancement of FAIRsharing.</i>
